> üí° **Password Tips**: Use a password manager to generate and store a strong, unique password.

## üì± Step 2: Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: MFA setup is mandatory. You cannot access AWS resources without MFA configured.**

### 2.1 Navigate to MFA Setup

1. After password change, you'll see the AWS Console
2. **Click on your username** in the top-right corner
3. **Select "Security credentials"**
4. **Scroll down to "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)"**
5. **Click "Assign MFA device"**

### 2.2 Choose MFA Device Type

You have two options:

#### Option A: Virtual MFA Device (Recommended for most users)

- Uses smartphone app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- Free and convenient
- Works offline

#### Option B: Hardware MFA Device (For high-security roles)

- Physical device (YubiKey, etc.)
- Most secure option
- Provided by company for Operations team

### 2.3 Set Up Virtual MFA Device

If you chose Virtual MFA Device:

1. **Select "Virtual MFA device"**
2. **Click "Continue"**
3. **Install an authenticator app** on your smartphone:

   - **Google Authenticator** (recommended)
   - **Authy**
   - **Microsoft Authenticator**
   - **1Password** (if you have a subscription)

4. **Scan the QR code** with your authenticator app
5. **Enter two consecutive MFA codes** from your app:
   - Wait for the first code to appear
   - Enter it in "MFA code 1"
   - Wait for the code to refresh (about 30 seconds)
   - Enter the new code in "MFA code 2"
6. **Click "Assign MFA"**

### 2.4 Set Up Hardware MFA Device

If you chose Hardware MFA Device:

1. **Select "Hardware MFA device"**
2. **Click "Continue"**
3. **Enter the device serial number** (found on the device)
4. **Insert the device** and press the button
5. **Enter the first authentication code**
6. **Wait for the next code** and enter it
7. **Click "Assign MFA"**

### 2.5 Verify MFA Setup

1. **Sign out** of the AWS Console
2. **Sign back in** using your username and password
3. **Enter the MFA code** when prompted
4. **Confirm successful login**

> ‚úÖ **Success!** You should now see the AWS Console with your role-specific permissions.

## üö® Security Best Practices

### Password Security

- **Use a unique password** - never reuse your AWS password elsewhere
- **Use a password manager** - to generate and store strong passwords
- **Change password regularly** - you'll be prompted every 90 days
- **Never share your password** - with anyone, including IT support

### MFA Security

- **Keep your MFA device secure** - treat it like a key to your house
- **Have a backup plan** - save recovery codes in a secure location
- **Report lost devices immediately** - contact DevOps team right away
- **Don't share MFA codes** - never give codes to anyone

### General Security

- **Always sign out** - when finished using AWS Console
- **Use secure networks** - avoid public Wi-Fi for AWS access
- **Keep software updated** - browser and MFA apps should be current
- **Report suspicious activity** - contact security team immediately

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cannot Login
