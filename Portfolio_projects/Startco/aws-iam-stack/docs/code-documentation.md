## Overview

This document provides detailed documentation for all TypeScript interfaces, classes, and enums used in the AWS security implementation.

**File Path**: `/Users/momodou/Documents/AWS/cea_cloudbootcamp/cloud_bootcamp27/Portfolio_projects/Startco/aws-iam-stack/lib/aws-iam-stack-stack.ts`

### Classes

#### AwsIamStackStack

Main AWS Security Implementation Stack This stack creates a comprehensive IAM security implementation for StartupCorp, transforming from a shared root account model to proper role-based access control. The stack implements: - Individual IAM users with MFA requirements - Role-based IAM groups (Developer, Operations, Finance, Analyst) - Least privilege permission policies for each role - Account-level security policies (password policy, MFA enforcement) - Comprehensive resource tagging for organization and cost tracking @example ```typescript const app = new cdk.App(); new AwsIamStackStack(app, 'AwsSecurityStack', {   env: {     account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT,     region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION   } }); ``` @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html} AWS IAM Best Practices @see {@link https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/security-identity-compliance/} AWS Security Best Practices @author StartupCorp DevOps Team @version 1.0.0 @since 2025-01-08

## iam-groups.ts

**File Path**: `/Users/momodou/Documents/AWS/cea_cloudbootcamp/cloud_bootcamp27/Portfolio_projects/Startco/aws-iam-stack/lib/constructs/iam-groups.ts`

### Classes

#### IamGroupsConstruct

CDK Construct for creating IAM groups for each team role This construct creates four IAM groups corresponding to the organizational roles: - Developers: For development team members with EC2 and application access - Operations: For infrastructure and operations team members with full system access - Finance: For finance and billing team members with cost management access - Analysts: For data analysts and reporting team members with read-only data access Each group is created with a standardized path (/teams/) for organization and will have role-specific policies attached by the IamPoliciesConstruct. @example ```typescript const iamGroups = new IamGroupsConstruct(this, 'IamGroups'); const devGroup = iamGroups.getGroupForRole(TeamRole.DEVELOPER); ``` @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html} AWS IAM Groups @see {@link TeamRole} for available team roles @author StartupCorp DevOps Team @version 1.0.0

## iam-policies.ts

**File Path**: `/Users/momodou/Documents/AWS/cea_cloudbootcamp/cloud_bootcamp27/Portfolio_projects/Startco/aws-iam-stack/lib/constructs/iam-policies.ts`

### Classes

#### IamPoliciesConstruct

CDK Construct for defining role-based permission policies This construct creates managed IAM policies for each team role, implementing the principle of least privilege. Each policy is tailored to the specific needs and responsibilities of each team: -Developer Policy: EC2 management, S3 app files, CloudWatch logs -Operations Policy: Full EC2, CloudWatch, Systems Manager, RDS -Finance Policy: Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, read-only resources -Analyst Policy: Read-only S3 data access, CloudWatch metrics, RDS describe All policies are automatically attached to their corresponding IAM groups and follow AWS security best practices with explicit resource restrictions. @example ```typescript const iamGroups = new IamGroupsConstruct(this, 'IamGroups'); const iamPolicies = new IamPoliciesConstruct(this, 'IamPolicies', iamGroups); ``` @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege} Least Privilege Principle @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html} Managed vs Inline Policies @author StartupCorp DevOps Team @version 1.0.0

## iam-users.ts

**File Path**: `/Users/momodou/Documents/AWS/cea_cloudbootcamp/cloud_bootcamp27/Portfolio_projects/Startco/aws-iam-stack/lib/constructs/iam-users.ts`

### Classes

#### IamUsersConstruct

CDK Construct for creating individual IAM users and assigning to groups This construct creates individual IAM users for each team member defined in the team structure and automatically assigns them to the appropriate IAM groups based on their roles. Features: - Creates IAM users with standardized naming and paths (/users/) - Automatically assigns users to correct groups based on their team role - Supports all team roles (Developer, Operations, Finance, Analyst) - Maintains a list of all created users for reference The construct processes the entire team structure and creates users for all team members across all roles, ensuring consistent user creation and group assignment throughout the organization. @example ```typescript const teamStructure: TeamStructure = {   developers: [{ username: 'dev1', email: 'dev1@company.com', role: TeamRole.DEVELOPER, requiresMFA: true }],   // ... other teams }; const iamUsers = new IamUsersConstruct(this, 'IamUsers', teamStructure, iamGroups); ``` @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html} AWS IAM Users @see {@link TeamStructure} for team structure definition @author StartupCorp DevOps Team @version 1.0.0

## security-policies.ts

**File Path**: `/Users/momodou/Documents/AWS/cea_cloudbootcamp/cloud_bootcamp27/Portfolio_projects/Startco/aws-iam-stack/lib/constructs/security-policies.ts`

### Classes

#### SecurityPoliciesConstruct

CDK Construct for configuring account-level security settings This construct implements critical security policies at the AWS account level: 1.Password Policy: Enforces strong password requirements including:    - Minimum 12 characters length    - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)    - 90-day password rotation    - Prevention of password reuse (last 12 passwords) 2.MFA Enforcement Policy: Requires Multi-Factor Authentication for all users:    - Denies all actions except MFA management when MFA is not present    - Allows users to manage their own MFA devices    - Implements conditional access based on MFA status The password policy is implemented using a custom resource since CDK doesn't have native support for account password policies. The MFA policy is a managed policy that can be attached to users or groups as needed. @example ```typescript const securityPolicies = new SecurityPoliciesConstruct(this, 'SecurityPolicies'); // Password policy and MFA policy are automatically created and configured ``` @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html} Account Password Policy @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html} Multi-Factor Authentication @author StartupCorp DevOps Team @version 1.0.0
