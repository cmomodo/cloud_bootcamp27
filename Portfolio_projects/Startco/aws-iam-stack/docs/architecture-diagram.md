# AWS Security Implementation Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture for StartupCorp's AWS security implementation, transforming from a shared root account model to a proper IAM-based security structure.

## Current State vs Target State

### Current State (Insecure)

- All 10 employees share AWS root account credentials
- No MFA or password policies
- Credentials shared via team chat
- Everyone has full administrative access
- Single point of failure and massive security risk

### Target State (Secure)

- AWS root account secured with MFA and used only for emergencies
- Individual IAM users with MFA enforcement
- Role-based access control through IAM groups
- Least privilege principle applied to each role
- Strong password policies and security controls

## Architecture Components

### IAM Groups Structure

- **Developers Group**: EC2 management, S3 app files, CloudWatch logs
- **Operations Group**: Full EC2, CloudWatch, Systems Manager, RDS
- **Finance Group**: Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, read-only resources
- **Analysts Group**: Read-only S3 data access, read-only database access

### Security Policies

- **Password Policy**: 12+ characters, complexity requirements, 90-day rotation
- **MFA Enforcement**: Required for all IAM users
- **Least Privilege**: Each role has minimum required permissions

### CDK Implementation

- Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK TypeScript
- Modular construct design for maintainability
- Comprehensive unit testing
- Automated deployment and validation

## Security Considerations

### Defense in Depth

- Multiple layers of security controls
- MFA required for all users
- Strong password policies
- Regular credential rotation
- CloudTrail logging enabled

### Compliance and Auditing

- All IAM actions logged via CloudTrail
- Regular access reviews and certifications
- Permission boundaries and least privilege
- Documented security policy decisions

## Next Steps

1. Deploy CDK stack to AWS environment
2. Configure MFA for all users
3. Test permission boundaries
4. Generate documentation screenshots
5. Train users on new security procedures
