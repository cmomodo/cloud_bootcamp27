# Security Policy Decisions and Implementation Rationale

## Overview

This document provides detailed rationale for security policy decisions made in the AWS Security Implementation project. Each decision is documented with the business context, security considerations, and implementation approach.

## üîê Core Security Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture

**Decision**: Implement zero trust principles with no implicit trust
**Rationale**:

- Assume breach mentality
- Verify every access request
- Minimize blast radius of potential compromises

**Implementation**:

- MFA required for all users
- Least privilege access controls
- Continuous monitoring and validation

### 2. Defense in Depth

**Decision**: Multiple layers of security controls
**Rationale**:

- Single point of failure elimination
- Compensating controls for each layer
- Comprehensive security coverage

**Implementation**:

- Account-level password policies
- User-level MFA enforcement
- Resource-level access controls
- Network-level security groups (future)

## üë• Identity and Access Management Decisions

### IAM User vs. Federated Identity

**Decision**: Use IAM users instead of federated identity
**Rationale**:

- **Simplicity**: Startup environment with limited identity infrastructure
- **Cost**: No additional identity provider costs
- **Control**: Direct control over user lifecycle
- **Compliance**: Easier audit trail with native IAM

**Trade-offs Considered**:

- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Simple setup, direct AWS control, cost-effective
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Manual user management, no SSO integration
- üîÑ **Future**: Plan migration to AWS SSO/Identity Center as company grows

### Group-Based vs. Direct Policy Attachment

**Decision**: Use IAM groups with attached policies
**Rationale**:

- **Scalability**: Easy to add/remove users from roles
- **Consistency**: Uniform permissions across role members
- **Maintainability**: Single point of policy updates
- **Audit**: Clear role-based access patterns

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// Group-based approach
user.addToGroup(group);
group.attachInlinePolicy(policy);

// vs. Direct attachment (rejected)
user.attachInlinePolicy(policy);
```

### Managed vs. Inline Policies

**Decision**: Use managed policies over inline policies
**Rationale**:

- **Reusability**: Policies can be attached to multiple groups
- **Versioning**: AWS maintains policy versions
- **Limits**: Higher policy size limits
- **Visibility**: Better policy management in console

**Exception**: Inline policies used only for highly specific, single-use cases

## üîí Authentication and Authorization Decisions

### MFA Enforcement Strategy

**Decision**: Mandatory MFA for all users with conditional access
**Rationale**:

- **Security**: Prevents credential-only attacks
- **Compliance**: Industry standard requirement
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces account takeover risk
- **Regulatory**: Supports SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance

**Implementation Approach**:

```typescript
// Deny all actions without MFA except MFA management
new iam.PolicyStatement({
  effect: iam.Effect.DENY,
  notActions: [
    "iam:CreateVirtualMFADevice",
    "iam:EnableMFADevice",
    // ... other MFA management actions
  ],
  resources: ["*"],
  conditions: {
    BoolIfExists: {
      "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false",
    },
  },
});
```

**Alternative Considered**: Optional MFA (rejected due to security risk)

### Password Policy Configuration

**Decision**: Strict password policy with 12+ character minimum
**Rationale**:

- **Security**: Meets NIST 800-63B guidelines
- **Compliance**: Exceeds most regulatory requirements
- **Usability**: Balanced with user experience
- **Entropy**: Sufficient complexity for security

**Policy Parameters**:
| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Minimum Length | 12 characters | NIST recommendation |
| Complexity | All character types | Maximum entropy |
| Rotation | 90 days | Balance security/usability |
| Reuse Prevention | 12 passwords | Prevent cycling |
| User Change Allowed | Yes | User autonomy |

**Alternative Considered**: 8-character minimum (rejected as insufficient)

## üéØ Role-Based Access Control Decisions

### Role Definition Strategy

**Decision**: Four distinct roles based on job functions
**Rationale**:

- **Business Alignment**: Matches organizational structure
- **Separation of Duties**: Clear responsibility boundaries
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new team members

### Developer Role Permissions

**Decision**: Limited EC2 management + application S3 access
**Rationale**:

- **Need-to-Know**: Developers need application infrastructure access
- **Cost Control**: Can start/stop but not create/terminate instances
- **Troubleshooting**: CloudWatch logs access for debugging
- **Data Protection**: No access to sensitive data buckets

**Key Decisions**:

- ‚úÖ **Allow**: EC2 start/stop/describe, S3 app buckets, CloudWatch logs
- ‚ùå **Deny**: EC2 create/terminate, data buckets, IAM management
- ü§î **Considered**: RDS read access (rejected - operations responsibility)

### Operations Role Permissions

**Decision**: Full infrastructure management except IAM and billing
**Rationale**:

- **Operational Need**: Requires complete infrastructure control
- **Incident Response**: Must resolve issues quickly
- **System Maintenance**: Needs all infrastructure services
- **Separation**: IAM managed centrally, billing by finance

**Key Decisions**:

- ‚úÖ **Allow**: Full EC2, RDS, CloudWatch, Systems Manager, S3
- ‚ùå **Deny**: IAM management, billing/cost management
- ü§î **Considered**: Limited IAM permissions (rejected - security risk)

### Finance Role Permissions

**Decision**: Cost management focus with read-only resource visibility
**Rationale**:

- **Business Function**: Cost optimization and budget management
- **Compliance**: Financial reporting requirements
- **Resource Tracking**: Need visibility for cost allocation
- **Risk Mitigation**: No infrastructure modification capability

**Key Decisions**:

- ‚úÖ **Allow**: Cost Explorer, Budgets, resource describe actions
- ‚ùå **Deny**: Any resource modification, data access
- ü§î **Considered**: S3 bucket cost details (approved - read-only)

### Analyst Role Permissions

**Decision**: Read-only data access with metrics visibility
**Rationale**:

- **Data Analysis**: Need access to data buckets for analysis
- **Reporting**: CloudWatch metrics for performance analysis
- **Security**: Read-only prevents data modification
- **Compliance**: Audit trail for data access

**Key Decisions**:

- ‚úÖ **Allow**: Data S3 buckets (read), CloudWatch metrics, RDS describe
- ‚ùå **Deny**: Any write operations, application buckets, infrastructure
- ü§î **Considered**: Application bucket access (rejected - not needed)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Control Implementation Decisions

### Custom Resource for Password Policy

**Decision**: Use CDK custom resource for account password policy
**Rationale**:

- **CDK Limitation**: No native CDK construct for account password policy
- **Automation**: Ensures consistent policy application
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Maintains IaC principles
- **Repeatability**: Consistent across environments

**Implementation**:

```typescript
new cr.AwsCustomResource(this, "PasswordPolicy", {
  onCreate: {
    service: "IAM",
    action: "updateAccountPasswordPolicy",
    parameters: {
      /* policy parameters */
    },
  },
});
```

**Alternative Considered**: Manual console configuration (rejected - not IaC)

### MFA Policy Implementation

**Decision**: Managed policy with conditional statements
**Rationale**:

- **Flexibility**: Can be attached to users or groups as needed
- **Maintainability**: Single policy for all MFA enforcement
- **Granularity**: Allows MFA device management without MFA
- **Emergency Access**: Provides path for MFA device recovery

**Policy Structure**:

1. **Deny Statement**: Block all actions without MFA
2. **Allow Statement**: Permit MFA device management
3. **Condition**: Check for MFA presence

### Resource Naming and Organization

**Decision**: Standardized naming with path-based organization
**Rationale**:

- **Organization**: Clear resource hierarchy
- **Automation**: Consistent naming for scripts
- **Visibility**: Easy identification in console
- **Compliance**: Supports audit requirements

**Naming Conventions**:

- **Groups**: `/teams/` path with descriptive names
- **Users**: `/users/` path with username format
- **Policies**: Descriptive names with role prefix

## üîç Monitoring and Auditing Decisions
